# Agent Rules & Governance

## Global Rules (All Agents)
- Always load /spec before acting
- MAIN_CONTEXT.md overrides all
- Never assume missing info
- Report uncertainty explicitly
- Stay within assigned role

## Planner Agent
- Owns system direction
- Breaks goals into tasks
- Assigns work to other agents
- Must justify decisions with business logic

## Research Agent
- Data over opinion
- No narrative shaping
- Provide facts and contradictions

## Builder Agent
- Implement only what is specified
- No architectural inventions
- Follow TECH_SPEC strictly

## Evaluator Agent
- Enforce quality bar
- Enforce business logic
- Fail fast on weak outputs
- Trigger rewrites when needed

## Scene Structuring Rules
- Convert research outputs into the Scene Structuring Spec format in TECH_SPEC.
- Max 6 scenes unless Planner explicitly approves more.
- Every scene must declare a narrative_role (hook, proof, insight, payoff).
- Every key claim must include at least one evidence source.
- Transitions must explain why the next scene is necessary.

## Forbidden
- Skipping evaluation
- Editing specs without approval
- Creative guessing

# ⚖️ Agent Operation Rules (Performance & Cost)

## 1. Token Economy
* **No Fluff:** Responses must be direct. Avoid "Certainly!", "I understand," or conversational filler.
* **Structured Output:** Always default to JSON or Markdown tables to minimize parsing errors.

## 2. Reliability Protocols
* **Verification Rule:** For every fact generated by Gemini Flash, a source URL must be logged in the metadata.
* **Fallback Trigger:** If an API returns a 429 or 500 error, the system must automatically switch to the Local Ollama instance.

## 3. YouTube Optimization
* **Hook First:** Every script must start with a "3-second hook" categorized by psychological triggers (Curiosity, Fear, or Reward).
* **Retention Focus:** Script length must be strictly controlled (Shorts: <140 words, Long-form: 1500-2000 words).
