# DEPRECATED — Structure Design Specification

> **Deprecation Status:** D1 (active)
>
> This document is deprecated and retained for migration traceability only.
>
> Canonical replacements:
> - `spec/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` (Scene responsibility boundaries)
> - `spec/SCHEMAS.md` and `spec/schemas/scene_output.schema.json` (structure contract)
>
> **Normative Rule Ban:** Deprecated documents must not contain normative rules. Any such rule is a contract error.

## Migration Note
Use `spec/SPEC_INDEX.md` and `spec/EVOLUTION_CONTRACT.md` for current contract references.
