# Execution Plan (Goal: $2K/month per channel)

## Operating Constraint
All specs, tasks, and artifacts must be written in English.

## Canonical Pipeline Reference
Use `spec/SYSTEM_ARCH.md` → **Canonical Pipeline Contract v1**.

`research → plan → script → scene → image → motion → metadata → validate`

## Phase 0 — Validation (Pre-Revenue)
- Prove deterministic stage execution and contract compliance.
- Establish baseline KPI and release cadence.

## Phase 1 — Reliability & Cost Control
- Enforce cache governance and retry policy.
- Enforce contract drift checks and regeneration scope matrix usage.

## Phase 2 — Multi-Channel Scaling
- Channel templates and config propagation.
- Channel-level SLO and cost reporting.

## Phase 3 — Revenue Optimization
- KPI-driven improvement loops.
- A/B packaging iteration with strict contract boundaries.

## Mandatory Governance
- Pre-release Contract Drift Checklist (see `spec/VALIDATION_PLAN.md`).
- Regeneration Scope Matrix (see `spec/EVOLUTION_CONTRACT.md`).
- Deprecated Doc Normative Rule Ban (see `spec/SPEC_INDEX.md`).
