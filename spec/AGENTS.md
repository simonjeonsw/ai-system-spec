# DEPRECATED — Agent Definitions & Responsibilities

> **Deprecation Status:** D1 (active)
>
> This document is deprecated and retained for migration traceability only.
>
> Canonical replacements:
> - `spec/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` (stage boundaries and responsibilities)
> - `spec/AGENT_RULES.md` (governance and rule enforcement)
>
> **Normative Rule Ban:** Deprecated documents must not contain normative rules. Any such rule is a contract error.

## Migration Note
Use `spec/SPEC_INDEX.md` for current authority and lifecycle status.
