# Channel Growth Strategy (2026 Standard)

## Purpose
Define phase-based operating rules that optimize for rapid monetization while preserving retention and trust.

## Phase-Based Operations

### Launch Phase (0–1k Subs)
- Primary goal: retention and completion rate.
- Standard long-form length: 5–6 minutes.
- Use Discovery Shorts as trailers to the long-form.
- Focus on clarity, strong hooks, and high-precision claims.

### Growth Phase (1k–10k Subs)
- Primary goal: watch time expansion and binge behavior.
- Standard long-form length: 8–10 minutes.
- Build series formats to encourage sequential viewing.
- Emphasize topic clustering and recurring narrative structures.

### Monetization Phase (10k+ Subs)
- Primary goal: revenue diversification and premium positioning.
- Add affiliate and digital product offers aligned with viewer intent.
- Optimize for SEO, community posts, and subscriber activation.

## Content Mix Strategy
- **Long-form (Master):** Deep explainer, 5–6 minutes in Launch Phase.
- **Shorts (Derivative):** 1–2 hook moments extracted from the long-form with a CTA back to the master video.

## Retention Engine (3-Step Structure)
1. Negative Hook (tension or risk framing)
2. Mid-Reward (early proof or surprising insight)
3. Open Loop (promise of resolution later)

## Packaging & CTR Strategy
- Provide two thumbnail concepts per episode (A/B).
- Add a community post teaser for each release.

## Contrarian Angle Requirement
Every topic must surface a contrarian angle to improve CTR and differentiation.

## Benchmarking & Learning Loop
- Continuously capture viral titles and visual hooks from competitor channels.
- Feed benchmark insights into planner scoring and packaging experiments.

## Visual Prompt Standard (Scene Engine)
- Default style preset: **Premium 3D Isometric / Blender Style**.
- Scene prompts should include hard-number overlays from research (e.g., inflation %, FX levels, rates) when available.
- Style presets must be configuration-driven via `config/visual_style.json` for future UI switching.
