Host is standing in front of a clean, modern backdrop.\\n[Narration] Ever feel like your savings are just... disappearing? You work hard, you save diligently, but somehow, your money just doesn't go as far as it used to. It's not your imagination. In fact, holding onto plain old cash might be the fastest way to make yourself poorer.\\n\\n[Visual] Animated graphic shows a dollar bill shrinking over time, with text overlay: 'Inflation'.\\n[Narration] We're talking about two major wealth-killers: inflation and exchange rates. Inflation is like a silent tax, gradually eroding your purchasing power. That $100 bill today buys less than it did last year, and will buy even less next year [src-001].\\n\\n[Visual] Animation transitions to show currency symbols fluctuating against each other. A globe appears with arrows pointing to different countries.\\n[Narration] Then there are exchange rates. If you travel, or buy imported goods, or even have international investments, a weakening local currency means your money buys less globally, and vice versa [src-002].\\n\\n[Visual] Split screen: one side shows a growing stack of coins, the other side shows a shrinking stack of coins with a dollar sign that's getting smaller.\\n[Narration] But here's the kicker: holding cash doesn't protect you from these forces. In fact, it often accelerates the wealth erosion. So, how can you fight back?\\n\\n[Visual] Host points to a whiteboard with simple bullet points: 'Invest', 'Diversify', 'Think Globally'.\\n[Narration] Stay tuned, because on this channel, we break down exactly how inflation and exchange rates chip away at your wealth and, more importantly, how you can protect and grow your money in any economy.\\n\\n[Visual] End screen with social media handles and a call to subscribe. Upbeat outro music begins.\\n[Narration] Don't forget to subscribe for more insights on preserving and growing your wealth!\",\n  \"citations\": [\n    \"src-001\",\n    \"src-002\"\n  ],\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\"\n}\n```"
