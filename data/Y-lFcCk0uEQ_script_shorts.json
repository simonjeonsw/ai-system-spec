Holding onto plain old cash might be the fastest way to make yourself poorer. We're facing two major wealth-killers: inflation and exchange rates.\n\n[Visual] Animated graphic shows a dollar bill shrinking over time, labeled 'Inflation'.\n[Narration] Inflation is a silent tax, eroding your purchasing power.

But how do you fight back? Stay tuned. We break down how these forces chip away at your wealth and, more importantly, how you can protect and grow your money in any economy.
