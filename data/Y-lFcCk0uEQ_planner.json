  "benchmark_insights": {
    "title_hooks": "Channels like Graham Stephan use direct, provocative questions and clear benefit statements (e.g., 'This is How I Made $1,000,000') to grab attention. Investopedia uses more descriptive, authoritative titles. SyukaWorld and 부읽남 often use strong visuals and direct calls to action in their thumbnails/titles.",
    "retention_graphs": "High retention often comes from clear narrative structures, visual aids (charts, graphs, animations), relatable examples, and consistent value delivery. Breaking down complex topics into digestible segments and using 'hook-recap' cycles are common."
  },
  "selection_rationale": "This topic scored highest due to its strong audience fit, excellent evidence availability, and high production feasibility. While its viral potential (7/10) is not the absolute highest, it is sufficiently high and the topic's direct relevance to wealth preservation makes it a compelling choice. The framing that 'holding cash makes you poorer' is inherently attention-grabbing and aligns with the desire of an insightful finance explainer's audience to understand and combat wealth erosion. The inclusion of both inflation and exchange rates offers a more comprehensive and novel perspective compared to focusing on just one element. The contrarian angle will be crucial for balancing the message and providing a nuanced perspective.",
