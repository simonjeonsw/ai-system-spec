      "notes": "This topic directly addresses the contrarian angle and viewer takeaway, making it highly relevant for an insightful finance explainer audience. The novelty is moderate as the concept of hard work not equaling wealth is discussed, but the systemic 'designed poverty' angle is less common. Viral potential is high due to the provocative nature of the title and its relatable, albeit counter-intuitive, premise."

      "notes": "This topic leans heavily into the novelty and contrarian angle. It's very specific about the cause (government designs). Audience fit is good but slightly less direct than the first option. Monetization potential is strong due to the controversial nature. Viral potential is good because it sparks debate and conspiracy-like curiosity."
